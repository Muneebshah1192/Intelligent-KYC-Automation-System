what do i do next::

1️⃣ Stop the FastAPI server

Since it’s running in your terminal:

Press CTRL + C in the terminal where uvicorn is running.

You’ll see something like:

INFO: Shutting down
INFO: Finished server process


This safely stops the server.

2️⃣ Deactivate your virtual environment

If your terminal shows (venv) at the beginning:

deactivate


This returns your terminal to normal.

3️⃣ Close your terminal

Now you can safely close PowerShell or Command Prompt.

All your code and database are safe. Nothing is lost.

4️⃣ Resume tomorrow

When you want to continue:

Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder:

cd F:\kyc_automation_system\backend


Activate the virtual environment:

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


Start the FastAPI server again:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload


Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.

You’ll be back where you left off. ✅
